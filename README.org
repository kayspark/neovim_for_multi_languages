* A neovim configuration for multiple languages,

This configuration is based on execellent LazyVim and referred lunarvim from time to time.

For those who is using multiple languages, neovim can be a excellent choice.
  This repository is for my workflow like below :
  - SQL with oracle databse
  - Java and C++ legacy projects
  - zsh/fish/nushell/xml/html for rutine works
  - Exciting experiment projects with Rust, Json and typescripts.

Codes are not cleaned up yet but it will be keep updated weekly basis.

My journey started with neovim_basic_ide.
