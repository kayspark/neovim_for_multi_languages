* A neovim configuration for multiple languages

This configuration is referring  LazyVim and referred dotfiles from Josh medesky, from time to time.

For those who is using multiple languages, neovim can be a good choice.
  This repository is for my workflow like below :
  - SQL with oracle database : vim-dadbod for query execution and completion
  - Java and C++ legacy projects
  - zsh/fish/xml/html for rutine works
  - Exciting experiment projects with Rust, Json and typescripts.

Installation instruction is same as LazyVim. Start with starter kit and add your preferred plugins by copying. lua/plugins/lsp directory can be ignored but I copied it due to reference and test purposes. Codes are not cleaned up yet but it will be keep updated weekly basis.

* multiple languages?
Key binding matters for non english users like me. for example,Ctrl+space for me means changing input languages. Howver many plugins are using it with other purposes.
In language servers, key binding for code actions also mattered but seems not cared carefully yet. So, I started to make this repository to share my experiments, someday can be a common practice hopefully.



* work in process
- rust and json for backend development with neovim
- vim-dadbod for database

* Recent Changes
** 2026-02-17
 - Git UI policy tightened to Neogit-first workflow.
 - Disabled default LazyGit key bindings from LazyVim Snacks (`<leader>gg`, `<leader>gG`) to avoid confusion.
 - Removed `ai.claudecode` extra (CLI workflow is primary).
 - Commented out language extras for easy later enable:
   - `lazyvim.plugins.extras.lang.rust`
   - `lazyvim.plugins.extras.lang.typescript`
   - `lazyvim.plugins.extras.lang.yaml`
 - Re-enable by uncommenting entries in `lua/config/lazy.lua`, then run `:Lazy sync`.

** 2026-02-06
 - Removed `sqls` integration from `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` and `neoconf.json`.
 - SQL workflow now uses `vim-dadbod` and `vim-dadbod-completion` only.
 - Added a Git signing runbook for contributors and agents: `docs/ops/git-signing.md`.

** 2026-02-02
 - **Configuration Health Check & Cleanup**:
   - Reviewed and updated the configuration to align with the latest LazyVim standards.
   - Cleaned up `lua/plugins/database.lua` to remove redundant settings.
 - **LazyVim Extras Update**:
   - The configuration now uses `aerial` instead of the deprecated `navic` for the symbols outline. It's recommended to remove the `navic` extra via the `:LazyExtras` command to avoid conflicts.

* key maps
This list includes all custom key maps defined in this repository. Default LazyVim key maps are not listed.

*** Git workflow (Neogit + Diffview)
This is the recommended day-to-day flow in this config.

**** 1) Add / stage changes
- Open Neogit status: ~<leader>gg~
- Stage from Neogit status buffer (Magit-style) for file/hunk selection.
- Or stage directly from code with gitsigns:
  - ~gs~ stage hunk
  - ~gS~ stage buffer
  - ~gh~ preview hunk before staging

**** 2) Commit
- Open commit flow: ~<leader>gc~
- Write commit message in the commit buffer.
- Save and confirm commit from Neogit.
- If commit signing is required, follow ~docs/ops/git-signing.md~.

**** 3) Fetch / pull / rebase
- Open Neogit: ~<leader>gg~
- Use Neogit popups to run fetch/pull/rebase operations.
- Tip: use ~?~ inside Neogit to see current buffer actions.

**** 4) Review diff before merge
- Open repository diff view: ~<leader>gd~ (DiffviewOpen)
- Close diff view: ~<leader>gD~ (DiffviewClose)
- Useful commands in command line:
  - ~:DiffviewFileHistory~ for file/repo history diff
  - ~:DiffviewToggleFiles~ to show/hide file panel
  - ~:DiffviewRefresh~ after branch updates

**** 5) Merge with diff
- Fetch and checkout target branch in Neogit.
- Open ~<leader>gd~ and review changed files before merge.
- Run merge from Neogit popup.
- If conflicts occur:
  - Use Diffview to inspect both sides and conflict locations.
  - Resolve in buffers, stage resolved files, then complete merge commit.

**** 6) Push
- Open Neogit: ~<leader>gg~
- Use push popup/action to push current branch.
- Prefer pushing only after diff review and clean status.

**** Quick habits
- Before commit: ~gh~ on important hunks + ~<leader>gd~ full diff pass.
- Before push: confirm no unstaged/untracked surprises in Neogit status.
- For history investigation: ~:DiffviewFileHistory %~ on current file.
